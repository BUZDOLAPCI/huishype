# HuisHype Consolidated Maestro Test Flow
# Single app launch that tests the complete user journey:
#   1. App launch & smoke verification (unauthenticated)
#   2. Feed browsing & filters
#   3. Search for a fixture property (deterministic navigation)
#   4. Bottom sheet exploration & auth gates
#   5. Dev login
#   6. Authenticated interactions (comment, guess, like, save)
#   7. Cleanup & final state
#   8. Cluster preview card (zoom out + tap cluster)
#
# Prerequisites:
# - App installed on emulator, Metro dev server running
# - Backend API accessible with seeded test fixture data
#   (run: pnpm --filter api run db:seed-fixture)
#
# Usage:
# maestro test apps/app/e2e/mobile/full-flow.yaml

# Clear app data to ensure unauthenticated state
# This removes persisted auth tokens from SecureStore
- clearState

# Launch the app
- launchApp

# Handle Expo Dev Client server picker (after clearState, always shown)
# Match both emulator (10.0.2.2:8081) and physical device (localhost:8081)
- tapOn:
    text: ".*10.0.2.2:8081.*"
    optional: true
- tapOn:

# Wait for the app to connect and show HuisHype header (dev client or app)
- extendedWaitUntil:
    visible: "HuisHype"
    timeout: 120000

# Dismiss Expo developer menu onboarding popup if it appears
# This popup blocks the app with "Continue" button after first server connection
- tapOn:
    text: "Continue"

# The developer menu may now be showing — dismiss it with back press
# Unlike the dev client launcher, back press on the dev menu overlay just closes it

# Tap on the map area to dismiss any remaining overlay
- tapOn:
    point: "50%,30%"
    optional: true
