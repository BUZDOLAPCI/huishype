When zoomed in enough to see buildings, we should see a rough 3d world with basic building blocks etc.

The map should show roads, greenery, trees, buildings, roads, crossings, streets etc.

I have attached an example screenshot from Snap Maps in close-up-map-visuals.jpeg

We can use the PDOK 3D BAG data for buildings.

Maybe we can this data into MapLibre's fill-extrusion layer. You set the fill-extrusion-height property to the building height provided by the government data.

Styling: We can set the colors to be similar to (close-up-map-visuals.jpeg), white, off white, grey-ish, beigey etc and add light properties to create the soft shadows.
