When zoomed out to a point where seeing details like separate buildings etc doesn't make sense; we should be seeing a visual similar to Funda's map. I have provided an example screenshot from Funda in map-visuals-zoomed-out.jpeg

The map should show roads, greenery, water etc as simple colors and lines, along with city/neighborhood/region names depending on zoom level.
