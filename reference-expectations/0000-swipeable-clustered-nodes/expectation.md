When a node cluster with more than 1 node is clicked (grouped dots on map), the preview/quick actions panel of the grouped nodes with swipable manner should show up. Like pages. I attached an example of this from funda in image funda-paged-group-previews.jpeg. It shows the previews popping up for 4 listing node group, currently showing 2nd of the 4.
